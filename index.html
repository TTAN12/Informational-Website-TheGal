		<h1>About us</h1>
		<!--gen bg-->
        <p>The Digital Gallery is an art technology startup with the potential to not only revolutionize inventory management in the art world but also to redefine how art is discovered, curated, and experienced by the public. Our mission is to build an innovative and inclusive art ecosystem that empowers all stakeholders. We strive to provide galleries with an efficient solution to inventory management and sale of backroom pieces through our online database, helping to free up valuable physical storage space.   
        </p>


		<h1>Key Features</h1>
		
		<h3>AI Driven earch</h3>
		<div id="feature" class="boxitem-grid">
			<div class="boxitem">
				<h3>AI Search</h3>
				<p>
					The AI search engine will help users find art that matches their preferences. Any art listed on the platform will have its themes, medium, color scheme, and other characteristics identified by AI, and the data from this will allow users to search for art using statements and even pictures. (e.g. “something with a contemplative feel” or searching for art that goes with a picture of a room that was uploaded) 
				</p>

				<h3>Artwork Descriptions</h3>
				<p>
					Our vision is to enhance the Philippine art industry by making backroom artwork accessible to more people through an accessible digital platform. By facilitating the sales and promotions of these hidden gems currently occupying storage spaces, we aim to help more art appreciators to take pieces of local art. Through partnerships with galleries nationwide, our goal is to clear current inventory backlogs of art galleries while expanding the market and supporting and development of Filipino artists.
