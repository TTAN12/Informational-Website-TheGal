        <p>The Digital Gallery is an art technology startup with the potential to not only revolutionize inventory management in the art world but also to redefine how art is discovered, curated, and experienced by the public. Our mission is to build an innovative and inclusive art ecosystem that empowers all stakeholders. We strive to provide galleries with an efficient solution to inventory management and sale of backroom pieces through our online database, helping to free up valuable physical storage space. We also seek to offer art collectors and enthusiasts a convenient one-stop platform to discover hidden gems from various galleries through intelligent filtering of our comprehensive artwork collection, making it easier for more people to experience and appreciate local art. Our vision is to enhance the Philippine art industry by making backroom artwork accessible to more people through an accessible digital platform. By facilitating the sales and promotions of these hidden gems currently occupying storage spaces, we aim to help more art appreciators to take pieces of local art. Through partnerships with galleries nationwide, our goal is to clear current inventory backlogs of art galleries while expanding the market and supporting and development of Filipino artists. Founded by Ateneo de Manila University ITE undergraduates Carlo Meguizo, Maico Vergara and Timothy Tan, the startup addresses the problem of outdated manual inventory management systems used by many art galleries in the Philippines.

        <p>The team’s original idea was to create an online digital art gallery that would allow artists to directly sell their work, bypassing the traditional brokers who typically take a 10% commission cut. However, It was through conversations with the gallery owners that Carlo discovered inventory management was a common pain point plaguing art galleries of all sizes. Despite the galleries being brokers between artists and buyers, they still struggled with outdated paper-based systems for tracking the thousands of pieces in their collections. This made basic tasks like auditing stock levels or locating specific artworks very time-consuming. 
            <br>According to the most recent economic impact report from the National Commission for Culture and the Arts, total annual sales from both public and private art galleries surpassed 30 million USD in 2020 alone. This figure is projected to rise steadily as art continues gaining popularity among both domestic and international collectors.

        <h2>The Problem</h2>  
        <ul>
            <li>Art merchants have difficulties showcasing their inventory to its full potential due to space constraints and the viewing time of buyers.&nbsp;</li>
            <li>A number of pieces are left unsold and are stored for long periods of time.</li>
            <li>Unsold pieces that have exceeded the time constraints agreed upon by the gallery and the artist will be pulled out and returned to the artist who will most likely recycle to create a new piece.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The art market is plagued by these inefficiencies:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Limited Exposure:</strong>      
                Galleries struggle to showcase their full inventory due to physical space constraints.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Undiscovered Gems:</strong>
                Valuable artworks remain hidden in backrooms, unseen by potential buyers.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Inefficient Inventory Management:</strong>
                Galleries lack tools to effectively manage and market their vast collections.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Limited Reach:</strong>
                Artists, especially emerging ones, struggle to gain visibility and reach a wider audience.
            </li>
          </ul>

		<h2>Our Product</h2>
		<p>A digital platform empowering galleries and artists to showcase their entire inventory, particularly hidden gems from their backrooms. Our search engine and detailed artwork descriptions will assist in inventory management and boost sales.</p>
		<img src="images/Website - Main(1).png" style="width: 720px; margin-left: auto;
  margin-right: auto; border: white solid; border-radius: 10px;">
		<h2>Features</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>Ai Driven Search:</strong> The AI search engine will help users find art that matches their preferences. Any art listed on the platform will have its themes, medium, color scheme, and other characteristics identified by AI, and the data from this will allow users to search for art using statements and even pictures. (e.g. “something with a contemplative feel” or searching for art that goes with a picture of a room that was uploaded) 
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Artwork Descriptions:</strong> To display the products in our platform in the best light, a specially curated backstory/description/sentiments will be shown alongside them. We will work with the gallery or artist to ensure that the descriptions displayed are as accurate as possible.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Value Proposition</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>We can showcase pieces that Art Galleries would usually not be able to showcase due to physical constraints.</li>
			<li>Clearing backroom pieces, opening up their inventory.</li>
			<li>Expanding customer reach by eliminating constraints caused by traditional methods such as requiring physical presence in galleries and individually messaging to showcase each piece.</li>
			<ul>
			  <li>If the customer is from Manila and the gallery is alabang they can still see and purchase with ease.</li>
			  <li>Opens the gates to sell local pieces internationally</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Through the AI driven search engine, galleries will be able to navigate through their inventory more efficiently and customers will be able to find specific pieces with ease.</li>
		  </ul>
		<h2>Roadmap</h2>
		<p>
			Stage 1: Research and Prototype Stage
		  </p>
		  <p>
			We have done significant work on validating our startup. We have visited several galleries, and have gotten important feedback from artists and curators. We’ll continue to be in talks with more art galleries. As for the prototype, a mockup of the website has been made on figma and progress has been made on the framework of the website. As soon as the prototype is ready, it will be tested with partnered galleries and reiterated based on feedback.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			Stage 2: Launch
		  </p>
		  <p>
			At this stage, we will start assembling our core development team. Then, we will start development and launch the beta version of the platform with select galleries and artists. During the beta, we will refine our platform based on user feedback and expand a wider audience. After that, we plan to introduce premium features for galleries and collectors, and start exploration towards international expansions.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			Stage 3: Growth
		  </p>
		  <p>
			As soon as we can determine that we have the finances and user base to scale, we will start scaling our enterprise. To ensure that the platform can handle the growth in users and transactions, we will optimize its technology infrastructure. Besides that, we will hire additional staff towards marketing, technical support, and logistics.&nbsp;
